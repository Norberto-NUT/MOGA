This simple and lightweight library will add "native" support of MOGA Bluetooth game controllers to your app.

Library was tested with good and inexpensive [MOGA Mobile controller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096L2SJ0/?tag=wpcentral00-20&ascsubtag=UUwpUvbUpU3563135); it also should work with the other MOGA game controllers.

You can use Windows 8.1/WP 8.1 builds with your W8.1 UWP or W10 UWP apps and games.

Enjoy!
